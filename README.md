### Analytics

This site uses Google Analytics (GA4) to collect anonymous traffic statistics. The Google tag is loaded in `app/layout.tsx` using Next.js's `Script` component. If you fork this project, replace the measurement ID (`G-RVXK82Q9L7`) with your own GA4 measurement ID or move it to an environment variable such as `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID` and update the code accordingly.
